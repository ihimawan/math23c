# 1.  Go  to  the  Internet  and  find  one  large  or  two  small  datasets  related
# to respiratory viral infectons, either Covid-19 or something historical like the
# “Spanish  flu”  of  1918  or  the  “swine  flu”  of  2009.   They  just  have
# to  besufficient for doing the problems that follow.  Convert the data to a .csv file
# that can be used by other members of the class.
#
# 2.  Using your datasets, make a boxplot and a scatter plot that show interesting relationships.
#
# 3.  Formulate an interesting hypothesis and test it by usng a permutation test.
#
# 4.  Find some aspect of your datasets than can be modeled by a discrete dis-tribution,
# and support your model with histograms and a chi-square test.
#
# 5.  Find some aspect of your datasets than can be modeled by a continuous distribution,
# and support your model with a histogram overlaid with a curveplus a chi-square test.
