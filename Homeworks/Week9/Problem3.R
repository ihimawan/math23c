"As a function of time, daily temperature is a fairly smooth function, and
using 100 Fourier coecients provided a good reconstruction for Boston.
Daily precipitation is not a smooth function of time. However, Califor-
nia has a rainy season and a dry season, and the annual cycle should be
revealed by Fourier analysis. Analyze the precipitation data in the le
LAWeather.csv using the same approach that was used for Boston temper-
ature in workshop problem 2. Introduce a variable ncoeff for the number
of Fourier coecients."
