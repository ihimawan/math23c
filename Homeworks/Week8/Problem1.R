# Does have a distribution that is approximately standard normal?

# Does the sum of the squares of the standardized samples have a distribution that is approximately
# chi-square with n = 6 degrees of freedom?

# If you multiply the sample variance by n - 1 and divide by sigma^2, does
# it have a distribution that is approximately chi-square with n - 1 = 5
# degrees of freedom?

# If you Studentize the sample mean, does the resulting random variable
# T have an approximate Student t distribution with n - 1 = 5
# degrees of freedom?
