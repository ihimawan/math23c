# Data Wrangling Problem 5
#
# Collect on your own (do NOT take data from the Internet), some data for which it is a reasonable hypothesis that the
# number of counts in variousbins ought to obey a Poisson distribution.  Examples:  emails per hour orper day, number of
# students arriving for lunch at Annenberg per minute.Save the resut in a .csv file(which might have just one column.)
# Display a histogram of your data side-by-side with a Poisson distribution that has the same mean.  and use a chi-square
# test to assess the match.  The prototypeis the analysis of Philliesâ€™ home runs in script 3
#
# For this task, I took the most annoying book in the world, "How to Win Friends and Influence People" and counted the
# frequency of the letter 'e' (either lower case or upper case) per 1000 alphabetic characters (i.e. I would not include
# spaces, new lines, special characters, numbers, etc.).
#
# Oh no, I wouldn't count this by hand. I have the python code in the `helpers` directory if you'd like to take a look at
# my logic.
