# Find  on  the  Internet  some  data  that  might  plausibly  have  been  sampled from  a
# continuous  distribution  (exponential,  gamma,  chi  square,  beta).
# Dispaly  a  histogram  of  your  data  and  overlay  on  it  a  graph  of  the
# den-sity function for your hypothesized distribution.  Then use integration is R
# to compute the expected number of counts in various bins,  and compare with the observed
# number of counts.  The prototype is the analysis for the exponential distribution in script
# 4D, but there the data were preassigned to bins.
